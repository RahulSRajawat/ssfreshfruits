The fruit has a large variety and more than 400 varieties of the fruit, some of which acclaimed worldwide, are produced in the southern, southwestern, and southeastern palm groves of Iran. There exists a good opportunity and a large potential for trade in this commodity in Iran. Due to climatic restrictions and the tropical nature of the date palm, dates are produced in 14 provinces of Iran together with Ghasre Shirin and Soumar in Kermanshah province, Tabas in the southern Khorassan province, Khor and Biabanak in Isfahan province, Taroud in Semnan province and extending from central to southern Iran.</p>

Hormozgan province, with a date productivity rate of 29.7 %, ranks first in the country followed by the provinces of Kerman, Khouzestan, Boushehr, and Fars, having a productivity rate of 18.8, 16.2, 11.8, and 11.6 percentages respectively. The production of dates from 192 hectares of palm groves in the country is approximately 877 tons with Kerman province (including Jiroft area) having the highest production share of 22.7 percent. Iran is the largest producer and exporter of dates in the world with exports of 51.2 and 59.3 thousand tons in the years 1996 and 1997 respectively.</p>
